<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="box">Tandoori Chicken is classically served in restaurants in a bright red hue because of the addition of a few drops of red food coloring. You can create a similar color with the addition of harissa paste and turmeric if you are averse to using the red food coloring.<p class="chicken">Chicken</p></div></div>

<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="box">Beef Teriyaki is a flavorful dish that you can have ready in about 30 minutes.This beef teriyaki is a homemade version of one of my favorite restaurant dishes. Every piece of beef is a little crispy and coated in a sweet and sticky teriyaki sauce! Itâ€™s delicious served over steamed rice for a quick weeknight dinner.<p class="beef">Beef</p></div></div>

<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><div class="box">Maki sushi (sometimes called norimaki) is when the rice and fish and/or vegetables are rolled up in a seaweed wrapper (nori). The roll is usually cut into six or eight pieces, depending on the thickness of the roll, and some itamae even place the items so carefully, that a picture results on the face of each piece.<p class="sushi">Sushi</p></div></div>
